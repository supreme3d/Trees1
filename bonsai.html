    <p>
      The Bonsai trees are some of the "smallest" trees around. Bonsai trees are
      small trees that are cultivated in a way that they don't have enough
      nutrition to grow into big trees so this means that any tree can be
      cultivated in the way of the Bonsai and you will get a cute little Bonsai
      tree. If you gave the Bonsai tree enough nutrition and space to grow it
      could grow into a big tree like one you would see at your local park.
